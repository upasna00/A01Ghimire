				Include your profile photo. 
				Include a second image - for example, as the background if you like. </p>

				Include an an embedded video (e.g. a YouTube tutorial or NWMissouri video).
				Use at least 15 different HTML tags, (e.g., html, head, body, title, br, p, a, div, span, ul, ol, li, img, link, form, input, button, header, footer, etc.)</p>

				<p>
					Use at least one CSS selector that styles by element, by id, and by class. (More is fine.)
					Include at least 3 pages: Home / YourChoice / Contact.
					Use a nicely styled navigation bar (see http://www.w3schools.com/css/css_navbar.asp (Links to an external site.))
					On your second page YourChoice, in a later assignment, you will use JavaScript to calculate something in response to user inputs. Suggestions include an online order form price calculation, calculation of the number of days since a user-provided date, calculation of the day of the week a user-entered date took place. The best ideas are ones you would actually use.</p><p>
						Your idea should be unique - using similar calculations will result in a 10% score reduction (and as always, highly similar code may trigger an academic integrity violation). Draft your idea and a user input form here, but you don't have to make it work yet.  Later, you will calculate and display result(s) on your YourChoice page. 
					On page 3, draft a contact form so users can say hello or ask you a question. (Again - it doesn't have to work yet.)
